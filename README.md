# simpleARMsimulater
This program reads arm assembly language from a file and simulates thier execution. It only supports a handful of instructions and is not pipelined. It was created as a university project.
It is incomplete and broken because of my failed attempt to implement some sort of pipelining. Needs lot of rework before it can be usable.
